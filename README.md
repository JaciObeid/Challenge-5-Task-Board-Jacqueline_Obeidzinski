# Challenge-5-Task-Board-Jacqueline_Obeidzinski
This is Jaci Obeidzinski's Challenge for Module 5. The landing page will have 3 columns labeled todo, in-progress and done for each step for a task. When the add task button is clicked a modal will show up to ask for a title, date and description of the task. Then a task card will apear with those inputs on it in the todo colunm. The cards can then be dragged into the other columns and will stay there when the page is refreshed.
